AKA _**INOT**_

## What?

A simple clone and redesign of the home page over at [inet.se](https://www.inet.se/). For those of you not from Sweden: Inet is a fantastic swedish computer supply store with great customer service ü§ì

## Why?

This project mainly serves as my first venture into using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) while also getting some more practice with React and TypeScript.

## How?

I've tried to keep my version relatively close to the original design but it's amazing what a few tweaks to border-radiuses and some box-shadows can do to modernize things a bit. All styling is done with tailwind classes.

## But!

Only the start page is implemented right now and the functionality is pretty bare bones. Some simple things work like toggles for _dark mode_ and _company mode_ but there's no other pages or navigation. I've tried my best to make things responsive and mobile friendly. Tailwind sure is crazy!
